/*
The BasicPackage class demonstrates how to create the most basic Visual Studio Package in C++.

--IVsPackage--

The IVsPackage implementation, which is required to be a Visual Studio Package, is inherited 
from the VSL::IVSPackageImpl class.

--Package Registration--

The implemenation of the registration and unregistration is provided by the combination of
BasicPackage.rgs, and VSDllRegisterServer and VSDllUnregisterServer in Package.cpp, which are
invoked by the tool Regit.exe, and the registry macros below, which provide the ATL required
implementation of static HRESULT WINAPI UpdateRegistry(BOOL bRegister).  There is post build
step included in the Package project to call Regit.exe to register this package in the experimental
hive.

The standard DllRegisterServer and DllUnregisterServer are also provided in Package.cpp; however,
registering with regsvr32.exe does not allow the package to be registered under the experimental
registry hive.

Because BasicPackage is specifically registered with VS, an instance can not be created via
CoCreateInstance.

CLSID_BasicPackage is GUID for this particular package, which is required by ATL and VSL.  The
value CLSID_BasicPackage will the key the package is registered under in the VS registry hive.

To register the package we call 'Devenv.exe /rootsuffix Exp ' in order to get the logo and product name
for the package to show up in the Help About dialog. 
The "/rootsuffix Exp" part of the command is to let VisualStudio know that we want to use the 
experimental registry hive.  The "/setup" lets VisualStudio know that we are running in the mode 
where it is looking for added/removed component to update itself.

When deploying a package to an end user machine, regit.exe can not be utilized to register the 
package.  Instead the Windows Installer should be used to write out the registry keys to normal 
Visual Studio registry hive and then run command 'Devenv.exe /setup'.

--IVsInstalledProduct--

The IVsInstalledProduct implementation, which is the programatic mean (versus the registry means,
which is not shown here) of having an entry on the Help About dialog, is inherited from the 
VSL::IVsInstalledProductImpl class.
